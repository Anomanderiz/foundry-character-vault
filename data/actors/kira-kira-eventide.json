        "value": "<p>Kira✧Kira Eventide began her life as Keira Étoile de Claret, a name as regal as the world she was born into. She hails from one of the oldest and wealthiest noble families in all of Faerûn, descended from the archdevil Fierna on her father's side, who lived on the opulent edge of the richest district in Silverymoon. </p><p>As the sole child of the current head of the family, Keira was treasured dearly by her parents, whom she adored in turn. She was incredibly sheltered and well-spoiled, receiving everything she ever wanted and an exceptional education. She became fluent in multiple languages because of it, although her excitable spirit often left her too distracted to study. Keira often spent her time in the estate's sprawling, colorful garden instead. A girly girl drawn to all things cute and pretty, born of an eladrin mother, she felt at home tending to the flowers. One day, she discovered something interesting resting amongst the blooms: a Sphinx of Wonder, his ethereal coat shimmering with stars. Enchanted by his beauty, the bright and curious girl began bringing him treats, which were usually desserts she had learned to bake herself as an afternoon tea enthusiast. Whenever she did this, she would also arrange an accompanying vase of her favorite seasonal flowers. In time, of course, the creature warmed to her presence. He began speaking openly with her about himself and eventually imparted his knowledge of Deep Speech, Elven, and the Celestial tongue. In truth, he was a deity who had lost much of his power when a dark goddess dealt him a venomous blow long ago. Unable to pronounce his true name correctly, the young Keira began calling him Lethe.</p><p>Her idyllic, peaceful youth was cut short when her parents were assassinated in the night by a rival noble house. Her memories of the event are hazy and fragmented, but she can still recall the screaming, the anguish, the glint of a dagger hovering inches from her face, and a certain crest etched into its hilt. Just before the blade could fall and snuff out her life as well, Lethe appeared and incinerated one of the two would-be assassins with a blast of radiant fire while a house guard named Thrum took down the other. The act, however, came at a steep price — Lethe, who had exhausted the last of his crippled power, lost the ability to speak and a good amount of his memories.</p><p>Orphaned, broken, and in shock, she was taken in by her aunt and uncle. Unlike her parents, they raised her with very little affection and rigid control, keeping her suffocatingly isolated. They saw her not as a person, not as their blood, but as a political asset. After she came of age, they arranged a marriage for her despite her protests — one that promised to bring them immense wealth and solidify their influence in the area. But in a cruel twist of fate, when the two were introduced, she saw that her intended groom wore a ring engraved with the same crest she had seen on the assassin’s dagger. When she told her guardians, they dismissed her concerns and accused her of being dramatic, difficult, and ungrateful. However, in her heart, she knew that they likely believed her and simply didn’t care...or perhaps, despite how much it pained her to consider this, there was a slight chance that they were involved in the plot. Either way, the alliance was too valuable for them to pass up, even if it meant wedding her into the family of her parents’ murderers.</p><p>Refusing to be a pawn in their game, the now twenty-one-year-old Keira fled.

        "public": "<h1>Backstory</h1><p>Kira✧Kira Eventide began her life as Keira Étoile Montfière, a name as regal as the world she was born into. She hails from one of the oldest and wealthiest noble families in all of Faerûn, descended from the archdevil Fierna on her father's side, who lived on the opulent edge of the richest district in Silverymoon. \n\nAs the sole child of the current head of the family, Keira was treasured dearly by her parents, whom she adored in turn. She was incredibly sheltered and well-spoiled, receiving everything she ever wanted and an exceptional education. She became fluent in multiple languages because of it, although her excitable spirit often left her too distracted to study. Keira often spent her time in the estate's sprawling, colorful garden instead. A girly girl drawn to all things cute and pretty, born of an eladrin mother, she felt at home tending to the flowers. One day, she discovered something interesting resting amongst the blooms: a Sphinx of Wonder, his ethereal coat shimmering with stars. Enchanted by his beauty, the bright and curious girl began bringing him treats, which were usually desserts she had learned to bake herself as an afternoon tea enthusiast. Whenever she did this, she would also arrange an accompanying vase of her favorite seasonal flowers. In time, of course, the creature warmed to her presence. He began speaking openly with her about himself and eventually imparted his knowledge of Deep Speech, Elven, and the Celestial tongue. In truth, he was a deity who had lost much of his power when a dark goddess dealt him a venomous blow long ago. Unable to pronounce his true name correctly, the young Keira began calling him Lethe.\n\nHer idyllic, peaceful youth was cut short when her parents were assassinated in the night by a rival noble house. Her memories of the event are hazy and fragmented, but she can still recall the screaming, the anguish, the glint of a dagger hovering inches from her face, and a certain crest etched into its hilt. Just before the blade could fall and snuff out her life as well, Lethe appeared and incinerated one of the two would-be assassins with a blast of radiant fire while a house guard named Thrum took down the other. The act, however, came at a steep price — Lethe, who had exhausted the last of his crippled power, lost the ability to speak and a good amount of his memories.\n\nOrphaned, broken, and in shock, she was taken in by her aunt and uncle. Unlike her parents, they raised her with very little affection and rigid control, keeping her suffocatingly isolated. They saw her not as a person, not as their blood, but as a political asset. After she came of age, they arranged a marriage for her despite her protests — one that promised to bring them immense wealth and solidify their influence in the area. But in a cruel twist of fate, when the two were introduced, she saw that her intended groom wore a ring engraved with the same crest she had seen on the assassin’s dagger. When she told her guardians, they dismissed her concerns and accused her of being dramatic, difficult, and ungrateful. However, in her heart, she knew that they likely believed her and simply didn’t care...or perhaps, despite how much it pained her to consider this, there was a slight chance that they were involved in the plot. Either way, the alliance was too valuable for them to pass up, even if it meant wedding her into the family of her parents’ murderers.\n\nRefusing to be a pawn in their game, the now twenty-one-year-old Keira fled. Thrum, her most trusted friend and personal guard by this point, naturally remained at her side. Deeply moved by Lethe's sacrifice, she pulled herself together and decided to devote her life to his mission of vanquishing evil and his restoration to power, although she still struggles greatly with guilt over the events of her past and overcompensates accordingly because of it. Setting out into the world as Kira✧Kira Eventide, the radiant and beautiful hero of justice and light in the darkness, she vowed to become a sparkling beacon of hope for the people so there would be no more tragedies like her own.\n\n✩✩✩\n\nKira and Thrum recently arrived in Waterdeep and are staying with her third cousins at their mansion.

      "bond": "Kira cares deeply for her trusted friend and personal guard, Thrum. She would do anything to protect him, although in battle the roles are most likely reversed. It doesn't stop her from trying, though. He's basically both her brains and her brawn.\n\nShe grew up with Lethe and is deeply grateful (and feels quite guilty) for his sacrifice. She agrees with his mission and wants to restore him to power while fulfilling it in his stead.",
      "flaw": "She tends to speak without really thinking, and often runs headfirst into dangerous situations. Although she'll whine about it, she's grateful that Thrum reigns her in when this happens. She's very honest and easy to read, which makes her a terrible liar. Sooner or later, the truth about her background is going to come out, and hopefully it won't be to the wrong people. It's really obvious that she's not a farmer and is most likely a noble.

You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</em></strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table.

You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>\n<p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>\n<p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a [[/save wis format=long]]. If the creature fails its save, it has the &amp;Reference[frightened]{Frightened} and &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} condition, or if you die.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 3: Cleric Subclass</b></p>\n<p>You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 5: Sear Undead</b></p>\n<p>Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 7: Blessed Strikes</b></p>\n<p>Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Divine Strike.</em></strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Potent Spellcasting.</em></strong> Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 8: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 12 and 16.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 10: Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p>You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p><p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p> <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p> <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p> <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p> <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p><h3>Position of Privilege</h3><p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul></ul>\n</div>\n</div>",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Telepathic Connection.</em></strong> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disappearance of the Familiar.</em></strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p><strong><em>One Familiar Only.</em></strong> You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>\n</div>",

You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>\n<p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.</p>\n<p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Divine Spark.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>\n<p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a [[/save wis format=long]]. If the creature fails its save, it has the &amp;Reference[frightened]{Frightened} and &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} condition, or if you die.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Telepathic Connection.</em></strong> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disappearance of the Familiar.</em></strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p><strong><em>One Familiar Only.</em></strong> You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>\n</div>",

The corpse must have a mouth, and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.</p>\n<p>Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.</p>\n</div>",

When given a leaf or other potential tea ingredient, its watery form gurgles happily as it begins to steep it, magically heating the water surrounding the ingredient to its ideal brewing temperature. It only picks up materials it chooses to and can control whether or not it's wet to the touch. The <em>tea weird</em> can inhabit up to 1 gallon of water, or as little as 1 ounce. Any water controlled by the <em>tea weird</em> is magical for the duration.</p>\n<p>The <em>tea weird</em> is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 5 feet and can hover up to 5 feet off the ground. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The <em>tea weird</em> regains all its hit points if given at least 1 ounce of water. Drinking the entire <em>tea weird</em> is harmless to you, but destroys the item.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>tea weird</em> is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 3, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 6. It has hearing and &amp;Reference[darkvision]{darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet. It can't speak or read, but understands Aquan and Common.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> The <em>tea weird</em> is dedicated to making tea. It will happily collect moisture, steep it with fresh ingredients, and then separate itself from the freshly brewed tea by pouring it into a cup or similar vessel. It avoids combat at all costs and enjoys resting in cups, kettles, or the pockets of friendly creatures.</p>\n</div>",

Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The GM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below.</p><p><em><strong>Willing.</strong></em> If your urging aligns with the monster’s desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.</p><p><em><strong>Unwilling.</strong></em> If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn’t comply.</p><p><em><strong>Hesitant.</strong></em> If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the same way again.</p><table><caption>Influence Checks</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Ability Check</p></th><th><p>Interaction</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>[[/check dec]]</p></td><td><p>Deceiving a monster that understands you</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check itm]]</p></td><td><p>Intimidating a monster</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check prf]]</p></td><td><p>Amusing a monster</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check per]]</p></td><td><p>Persuading a monster that understands you</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check ani]]</p></td><td><p>Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",

To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell’s magic requires @UUID[.0a2umg2mJMAzM9Q3]{Concentration}, which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn.

Otherwise, the extent of the &amp;Reference[ill]{illusion} is up to you.</p>\n<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>\n<p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[inv]{Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n</div>",
