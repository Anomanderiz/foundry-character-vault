Foundry Character Vault (static)

Workflow:
1) In Foundry (as GM), run the macro in `foundry-macro-export.js`.
   - It downloads one JSON file per PC.

2) Copy those JSON files into:
   /data/actors/

3) Rebuild the manifest:
   node tools/build-manifest.mjs data/actors data/manifest.json

4) Host the folder as a static site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc).
   - Open index.html and you’re done.

This viewer renders dnd5e nicely. For other systems, it falls back to a raw JSON view.
